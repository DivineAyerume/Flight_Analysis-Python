# **Flight Analysis**
This project will provide insights into U.S domestic flight patterns and performance based on [flight data from 2019 to 2023](https://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023?resource=download&select=flights_sample_3m.csv).
The analysis has been conducted with two key stakeholders in mind:
* Customers planning travel in the U.S. who want to select the most convenient options in terms of airline, day and time of travel.
* Aviation industry stakeholders looking to optimize operations and improve areas needing more attention.

The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help guide customers in trip planning while assisting the aviation industry in enhancing reliability, schedules and overall flight performance.
